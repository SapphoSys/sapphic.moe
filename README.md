# 🌸 [sapphic.moe](sapphic.moe)
The website for the Sapphic Angels system.

## Self-hosting
Please don't bother. The source code contains a lot of complicated parts that it'd be annoying to write documentation for. Production deployment is another story.

If you still insist, know that:
- you MUST include and comply with the zlib license.
- you CANNOT twist the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license in any way for content posts.
- we're NOT responsible if something breaks on your end.
- you're on your own and we will offer NO support whatsoever.

You're better off just making your own website instead.
