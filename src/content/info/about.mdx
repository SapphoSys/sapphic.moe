### Who are we?

Hello! Thanks for stopping by. We're the **Sapphic Angels** system. 

We're computer science students at the [Almaty Management University][almau] in Almaty, Kazakhstan, specializing in Software Engineering.

We have a fascination for anything related to system administration, and as hobbyist sysadmins, we self-host software for specialized needs, whether it's for ourselves or for our partners.

Due to our impaired eyesight, it's our mission to strive for accessibility where possible! We want to start by providing alt text where possible for our services. For example, the images that you see in our articles all have alt text in them.
